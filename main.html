  <h1>Fable Tactics</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Fable Tactics, a stat-based take on chess. Use this page to get set up and learn the basics before diving into a match.</p>
  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Visit the <a href="dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> to choose a piece type and view its stats.</li>
    <li>Press <strong>Start Game</strong> on the dashboard to launch the board.</li>
    <li>Play the game on the <a href="game.html">Game Board</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>Each piece has hit points (HP), attack (ATK), defense (DEF), and sometimes a movement limit (MOVE). Damage is calculated as <code>max(1, ATK âˆ’ DEF)</code> and you win by defeating the opposing king.</p>
