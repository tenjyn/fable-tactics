# Fable Tactics

## Dashboard

Open `index.html` to view piece statistics, choose a piece type, and start a new game. Clicking **Start Game** loads `game.html`, which contains the chess board.

## Testing

Install dependencies and run the test suite with:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The test suite uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to cover core game engine functions such as setup, movement, and combat resolution.
