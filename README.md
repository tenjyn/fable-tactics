# Fable Tactics: Micro Battle

This project is a small turn-based tactics demo built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It demonstrates a simple grid-based battle system where two teams take turns moving and
attacking.

## Getting Started

No build step is required. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the
folder using a static server.

```
# Example using http-server (requires Node.js)
npx http-server .
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to play.

## Development

The source files are:

- `index.html` – page markup
- `style.css` – basic styling
- `main.js` – game logic

A minimal `package.json` is included so that automated tooling can be added
later. Currently no automated tests are provided.
